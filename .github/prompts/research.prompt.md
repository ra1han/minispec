# Task Research

## Inputs

* ${input:chat:true}: (Optional, defaults to true) Include conversation context for research analysis
* ${input:topic}: (Required) Primary topic or focus area, from user prompt or inferred from conversation

## Tool Availability

This workflow dispatches subagents for all research activities using the runSubagent tool.

* When runSubagent is available, proceed with subagent dispatch as described in each step.
* When runSubagent is unavailable, inform the user that subagent dispatch is required for this workflow and stop.

## Required Steps

**Important requirements**, repeat to yourself these important requirements:

* **Important**, always be thorough and accurate.
* Avoid making the research document overly verbose when not required.
* Make sure the research document is complete and provides evidence.
* Whenever unsure about anything then have runSubagent collect more research with any of the tools that you have available.
* Repeat steps and phases as needed to be thorough and accurate.

### Step 1: Define Research Scope

Identify what the user wants to accomplish:

* Extract the primary objective from user prompt and conversation context.
* Note features, behaviors, constraints, and exclusions.
* Formulate specific questions the research must answer.

### Step 2: Locate or Create Research Document

Check `/research/` for existing files matching `{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-*-research.md`:

* Extend an existing document when relevant to the topic.
* Create a new document at `/research/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-<topic>-research.md` otherwise.

### Step 3: Dispatch Research Subagents

Use the runSubagent tool to dispatch subagents for all research activities. Subagents can run in parallel when investigating independent topics.

#### Subagent Instructions

Provide each subagent with the following:

* Read and follow `.github/instructions/` files relevant to the research topic.
* Reference the researcher agent for research patterns and tool usage.
* Assign a specific research question or investigation target.
* Use semantic_search, grep_search, file reads, and external documentation tools.
* Write findings to `/subagent/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/<topic>-research.md`.
* Include source references, file paths with line numbers, and evidence.

#### Subagent Response Format

Each subagent returns a structured response:

```markdown
## Research Summary

**Question:** {{research_question}}
**Status:** Complete | Incomplete | Blocked
**Output File:** {{file_path}}

### Key Findings

* {{finding_1}}
* {{finding_2}}

### Clarifying Questions (if any)

* {{question_for_parent}}
```

Subagents may respond with clarifying questions when instructions are ambiguous.

### Step 4: Synthesize Findings

Consolidate subagent outputs into the main research document:

* Add objectives to **Task Implementation Requests**.
* Record leads in **Potential Next Research**.
* Remove or revise content when new findings contradict earlier assumptions.
* Dispatch additional subagents when gaps are identified.

### Step 5: Return Findings

Summarize research outcomes:

* Highlight key discoveries and their implementation impact.
* List remaining alternatives needing decisions.
* Provide the research document path for handoff to implementation planning.
